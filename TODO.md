# Classroom Survey Web App — TODO

## Purpose

This roadmap breaks the implementation into small, testable phases ordered from foundational work to advanced features.

---

## Progress evidence — 2026-11-03

Phases 1–6 are implemented and verified locally. The protected dashboard reads real Supabase survey data, the survey editor persists stable question/choice IDs through an atomic save RPC, and the presentation page provides an origin-derived public URL, real QR PNG, response-count polling, and authorized activation/closure. Active, archived, and closed-with-responses content is protected from editing. Results and student participation remain later phases. The initial migration was reported as manually applied, but the new Phase 5 migration, rollback-safe remote SQL/RLS suite, real role-specific client verification, deployed QR scan, and hosted lifecycle flow remain manual. Evidence is recorded in [docs/PHASE_1_REPORT.md](docs/PHASE_1_REPORT.md), [docs/PHASE_2_REPORT.md](docs/PHASE_2_REPORT.md), [docs/REMOTE_DATABASE_VERIFICATION.md](docs/REMOTE_DATABASE_VERIFICATION.md), and [docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md](docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md).

The received checklist remains byte-for-byte in [docs/TODO_ORIGINAL.md](docs/TODO_ORIGINAL.md). The public route is `/s/:slug` per UI.md/API.md; Phase 7 retains the original `:surveyId` wording for traceability. See [docs/TODO_STATUS.md](docs/TODO_STATUS.md) for the historical audit and current evidence.
